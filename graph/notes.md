Concepts are described by or extracted and or created from Words.
Compound words in the compiler are used to join multiple concepts together.
Abbreviations are also used. Common variable names.
A graph of identifiers in the gcc compiler with all paths between them would be a set of predicates that could be turned into sentences.
We could see a matrix of identifiers with sentences in the cells describing the connections between them.
Some nodes have weak connections, partitioning or layering the matrix would allow for easier understanding.
The string of words in a path could be described by a function. The block of code in the function body would generate the path.
A simple concept matrix for the compiler might have these nodes :

Source
File
Compiler
Directory
Token
Type
Byte
Integer
Enum
Function
Declaration
Statement
Expression
Structure
Union
Operator
Operand
